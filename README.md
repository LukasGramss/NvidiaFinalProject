# NvidiaFinalProject
this project uses imagenet to detect whether or not a t-shirt is white or colored. This would aid people in the automation of daily chores, 
such as laundry. This program works by importing a picture of a t-shirt and running the code, which will result in an output of the image
showing whether or not it is detected as a white shirt or a colored shirt. To use this code, download the dataset and the resenet18.onyx as 
well as the finalpro.py file into the nano and run the code.
